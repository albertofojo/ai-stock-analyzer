**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Action:** BUY
**Reason:** The company's current PER (11.845454) is below the threshold of 50 and close to the historical minimum, indicating undervaluation. The distance to the MA200 (0.67%) is minimal, suggesting a good entry point. Additionally, the company's debt and cash position, growth, and margins should be further analyzed, but based on the provided technical and fundamental data, the stock presents a favorable buying opportunity.
