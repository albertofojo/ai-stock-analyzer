**Action:** buy
**Reason:** Current PER (8.24) is below the ideal range of 10-20, and significantly below the general 'danger' threshold of 50. The distance to MA200 (-27.95%) indicates the stock is below its 200-day moving average, which is a favorable 'buy zone' condition according to Miguel's methodology.
