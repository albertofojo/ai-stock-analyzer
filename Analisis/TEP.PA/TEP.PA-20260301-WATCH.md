**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Action:** buy
**Reason:** The company's current PER (6.3791823) is below the threshold of 50 and appears to be significantly below the 5-year average, suggesting a potential undervaluation. Additionally, the distance to the MA200 (-24.26%) indicates that the price is below the 200-day moving average, which could be a favorable buying zone.
