**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Action:** buy
**Reason:** Current PER (7.44732) is significantly below the 'danger' threshold of 50 and ideally within the 10-20 range for stable companies, indicating undervaluation. The distance to MA200 (-38.92%) suggests the price is below the 200-day moving average, which is a favorable buy zone.
